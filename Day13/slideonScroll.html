    <p>The process of building a house is a very complex and difficult task. In the following paragraphs, I will be explaining the many different steps that are required to build a house. 
        The first thing in building a house is selecting a lot and lot preparation. The land has to be cleared of trees and brush and graded to ensure a level building area. This process is usually called excavating and grading. This is usually a very fast process but can be costly depending on the job. 
        Also the land has to perk which means the land is not too wet and is safe for a structure and allows a septic tank to be installed that will function properly. </p>
    <p>When the framing crew is finished, the framing has to be inspected and passed before the next process can begin.
        The next process is for the electricians and plumbers to begin. The electricians will completely wire the house while the plumbers will only put in the first stage of pipes. The reason for not completely plumbing is because the showers, sinks, and toilets are the very last items to be installed.
        After the wiring and<img class ="align-right slide-in" src="http://unsplash.it/400/400"> preliminary plumbing are complete, insulation and installing the windows on the house are done. Using a good insulation and good windows will help reduce the heating and cooling costs of the homeowner. This is a step in building a house that you should spare no expense. The insulation and windows will pay for themselves in the long run.
        Next, the builder will be hanging sheetrock. The sheetrock is the base interior wall covering. After the sheetrock is hung, the painting or wallcovering can be done. Once painting is completed, the carpet installation or other floor coverings can be installed. This is self-explanatory.
        Inside trim will also be done during this phase. This includes various molding and window casings and other items to be done to the specifications of the homeowner.</p>
